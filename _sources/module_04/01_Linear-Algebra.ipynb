    "The first episode in the wonderful video series, [_\"Essence of Linear Algebra\"_](http://3b1b.co/eola) tells you of three different ideas about vectors [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For physicists, a vector is an \"arrow\" of a given length (magnitude) and direction. It can represent directional quantities like velocity, force, acceleration.\n",
    "2. For computer scientists, a vector is an ordered list of numbers. It can represent a set of variables or features stored in order.\n",
    "3. For mathematicians, vectors are generic objects that behave a certain way when they are added or scaled:  $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}$, $\\alpha\\mathbf{v}$.\n",

    "But, as you saw in your first example of Linear algebra for a set of\n",
    "equations, the vector could be a set of known or unknown values. This is\n",
    "closer to how vectors are treated in computer science and data science,\n",
    "vectors are often multi-dimensional, that is, they have many components.\n",
    "They contain a set of ordered variables in a data model, like for\n",

    "\n",
    "## Adding and subtracting scaled vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In your first linear algebra problem, you had the vector, $\\mathbf{x}=[c_1,~c_2,~c_3]$ and solved for $\\mathbf{x}=[3.86,~2.33,~1.44]~mg/m^3$. You separated the flow rates out of the equation, but you could also have pulled out the flow rates in three vectors:\n",
